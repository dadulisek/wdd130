            <p>Hello, my name is David Navratil. I am from Czech Republic. I was born in Czech Republic but I have lived all around the world.
                Some of my faivorite places to live were Orange County in California and Bay Area California, when it was still nice to live there.
                I also enjoyed staying on Hawaii and St. George Utah. Since me and my family were traveling so much I was homeschooled for most of my life.
                There were few exeptions when I went to High School in St. George Utah. My faivorite things to do is study history and geography. I also love
                playing video games from historical setting which I'm curently learning about. I also love watching Ice Hockey. Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
